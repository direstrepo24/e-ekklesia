# Seed Quickstart with Webpack

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> I want to write fast, reliable and efficient web apps. Quickly.  \
And I like documentation and WebAssembly.

Main parts:

- **[Seed](https://seed-rs.org)** - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) framework, inspired by [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/).
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - CSS framework. All CSS classes (not only Tailwind's(!)) are typed for safe use in Rust code. Unused classes are automatically deleted for much smaller bundle size.
- **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - When I need to go to the dark world of Javascript. I can generate Typescript types from Rust code for safer communication.
- **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)** - It needs a little bit of magic to setup, but it's flexible and fast enough. Also it has many useful loaders and plugins and dev-server that is accessible from mobile devices.

- Automatically deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) from `master` branch by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/).
- Compressed app size with assets is about 105 KB (look at _Developer Tools_ on demo page).

# Basic workflow

![](readme_video.gif)

_(Recorded in [ScreenToGif](https://github.com/NickeManarin/ScreenToGif/))_

1. Start dev-server with `yarn start`.
1. Open `127.0.0.1:8000` in my browser. Or something like `192.168.0.5:8000` on my phone.
1. Change code & save it.
1. Check changes in browsers.
1. Run tests on NodeJS with `yarn test`. Or for specific browser e.g. `yarn test:firefox`.
1. If I haven't configured `.travis.yml`, I have to run `yarn build:release` and upload `/dist` folder into my server.

# I need to install

1. [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install)
1. [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
1. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)

# How to create my new app

1. Clone or download this repo.
1. Choose name for my app. E.g. "iamgroot".
1. `/package.json` - Change `author` and `name` set to "iamgroot".
1. `/crate/Cargo.toml` - Change `authors` and `description`, `name` set to "iamgroot".
1. `/entries/index.ts` - Change word "appname" to "iamgroot" everywhere.
1. `/entries/index.html` - Change `title`.
1. Modify `/README.md`, `/LICENCE` and `/CHANGELOG.md`.
1. Run command `yarn` in the project root.
1. _[Optional]_ Push new app into my repository. (GitHub [guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line)).
1. _[Optional]_ Setup auto-deploy into [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) through [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org). (See chapter [Continous integration](#continous-integration)).

# Commands

- **`yarn build`** and **`yarn build:release`**

  - Bundle app and save it into `/dist`.

  Build pipeline:

  - Remove previous build from `/dist/`.
  - Generate styles from `/css/styles.css` (see `/configs/postcss.config.js`).
  - Generate `/crate/src/generated/css_classes.rs` from styles.
  - _[only release]_ Filter out unused CSS classes from styles.
  - Process styles with [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).
  - Compile Rust:
    - `/crate/` will be built into `/create/pkg/`.
    - Typescript files included in Rust code (see `/crate/src/ts_apis.rs`) will be copied to `/crate/pkg/snippets/[id]/src/ts/`.
  - Bundle assets (css, images, ts, js...) and _[only release]_ uglify/minify them. (See `/configs/webpack.config.js` and `/configs/tsconfig.json`)
  - Compile template `/entries/index.html` (i.e. Add bundle link into template and save result into `/dist/`).
  - Copy files from `/static/` into `/dist/static/`.
  - _[only release]_ Optimize `/dist/[name].wasm` for size (see `/scripts/optimize_wasm.js`).

* **`yarn start`**

  - Build project and start developer server on `127.0.0.1:8000`.
  - Server auto-reloads browser tabs on changes.
  - It doesn't destroy state if I change only styles (hot reload).
  - I can connect mobile devices to dev server:
    1. _Note:_ Devices and server have to be connected to the same network.
    1. [Find out](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-local-ip-address) local IP of the device where the dev server is running.
    1. Connect mobile device with that IP and server port. E.g.: `192.168.1.5:8000`.

* **`yarn test`**

  - Run tests in NodeJs.

* **`yarn test:{browser}`**

  - Run tests in headless browser.
  - `{browser}` should be `firefox`, `chrome` or `safari`.

# Browser and platform support

Quickstart has been tested in:

- `Firefox`, `Chrome` and `Edge` on Windows 10 (desktop PC)
- `Firefox`, `Chrome` and `Safari` on iOS (iPhone SE)
- _[I can create PR or Issue]_

There isn't integrated compilation from Wasm to Js, so IE is not supported. (However It should be possible with [wasm2js](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen).)

# Used in projects

- One in development in private repository for now.
